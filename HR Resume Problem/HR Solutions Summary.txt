This was a group project on utilising data analytics to solve the issue the HR problem of hiring the right people.

HR departments usually face thousands of resumes everyday. Our solution was to predict who were the top several candidates based on several models.

The datasets used included the IBM HR dataset, and several fictitious resumes that we created / found. We also utilised several psychometric traits from the OCEAN model as part of our prediction process.

1) We used resume parsing (i.e. text analytics) to score resumes based on certain keywords. This will reduce drastically the number of resumes the HR department has to scan through.
2) We predicted how long someone will stay with the company.
3) We predicted how happy someone will be in the company, on the assumption that happier employees are more productive and have a positive impact on the company culture.
4) We predicted how well someone would perform in the company.

We used several techniques including but not limited to linear regression, logistic regression, CART, and text analytics with quanteda. All codes are in R.
