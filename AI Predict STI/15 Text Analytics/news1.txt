SINGAPORE stocks said farewell to 2013 on positive ground on Tuesday, ending the year just a tad above the level it started with.
The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) finished 14.14 points, or 0.45 per cent, higher yesterday to 3,167.43. The late flourish meant that the index was 0.01 per cent in front for the whole year.
Trading volumes were bright despite it being a half-day session, with 2.9 billion shares worth $1.2 billion changing hands.
A total of 22 stocks among the 30 STI component counters enjoyed bright outings yesterday, with four losers and another four finishing unchanged.
