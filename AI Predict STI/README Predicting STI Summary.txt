This project is to predict whether the Straits Times Index (STI) would go up or down the next day, using many different kinds of models and methods, namely:

- Moving Averages
- Autoregression
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Quantile Regression
- MARS
- CART
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- MLP
- LSTM
- Gaussian Mixture Model
- Naive Bayesian
- SVM

I also utilised text analytics / sentiment analysis to see if there is a correlation between STI prices and the sentiment in news articles.

Do note that the scope of this project is more about the utilisation of several models to solve a problem, and not how to optimise said models.
