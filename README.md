# resume_projects
Welcome to my repository of several projects that I have done.

1) R Shiny UI Project shows a user interface that I had to self-learn and build from scratch using the RShiny package.
2) HR Resume Problem is a group project showing how we tackled the issue of sieving through thousands of resumes and using models to predict what sort of traits we should look for when hiring employees.

Hope you enjoy your time here!
